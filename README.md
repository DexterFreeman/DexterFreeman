# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dexter, an ambitious Junior Full-Stack Developer with experience in a variety of projects, ranging from simple Java terminal games to full-stack web applications! I recently graduated from Brunel University with a 2:1 in Computer Science and have been training with _nology to develop and refine my software engineering skills. I possess comprehensive technical capabilities with a strong knowledge of programming software, application, and development. 

## Projects

### Full-Stack Django Web Application

This was a full-stack web application built using Python/Django for the backend, Node.js for the frontend, and React (class based components) & Material UI for the UI. It was designed to help users organise and manage their online meetings. I utilised the Zoom API, Google Calendar API and a REST API for this project. 

### Tetris

A classic game of Tetris built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. The game is displayed using HTML canvas, goes up to 10 levels and mimics the "death screen" of the classic Tetris game while additionally having the modern feature of holding blocks. 

### Group Project: Client Project - Skin clinic front-desk system

A group project that I and other trainees at _nology created in two weeks, which involved creating a front desk and stock system for a skin clinic. We used HTML, SASS & React (functional based components) for the frontend and Firebase authentication for a login system. Each component/page is tested using React Testing Library. We uilised Scrum to complete this project, in 4 day sprints. Each sprint I peer programmed with a different trainee. 

### Calculator

I created a calculator using vanilla JS, HTML and SASS. I've also done some E2E testing using Cypress. The calculator can: add, multiple, divide, subtract, square root, percentage, use negative numbers, decimals, roound to the nearest whole number, use scientific notation and use PI. 

### Hangman & Snap Card Game

Two Java games which use the terminal for the UI and user input.
