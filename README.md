# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dexter, an ambitious Junior Full-Stack Developer with experience in a variety of projects, ranging from simple Java terminal games to full-stack web applications! I recently graduated from Brunel University with a 2:1 in Computer Science and have been training with _nology to develop and refine my software engineering skills. I possess comprehensive technical capabilities with a strong knowledge of programming software, application, and development. 

## Projects

### Full-Stack Django Web Application

This was a full-stack web application built using Python/Django for the backend, Node.js for the frontend, and React & MateriaLUI for the UI. It was designed to help users organise and manage online meetings.

### Tetris

A classic game of Tetris built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. 

### Group Project: Skin Clinic Front Desk and Stock System

A group project that I worked on, which involved creating a front desk and stock system for a skin clinic. We used React for the frontend, Firebase for authentication, and a Java/Spring Boot backend. Each component/page was tested using React Testing Library, and instead of CSS we used SCSS/SASS.

### Hangman Game
